# Week 3 - Callback to Async/Await

## ✅ Task:
Refactor callback-based async operations into modern async/await style using Promises.

## 📂 Modules Used:
- `fs/promises` from Node.js

## 🔁 Original Callback Code:
Used `fs.writeFile()` and `fs.readFile()` with nested callbacks.

## ✨ Refactored:
Used `async/await` with `fs.promises` for better readability and error handling.

## 📄 How to Run:

```bash
node index.js
